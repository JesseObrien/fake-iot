# fake-iot

This project is an exercise in design, code quality and showing the ability to think through approaches carefully. It is meant to be an example of how I would design a system that consumes data from a client that's sending metrics and in turn show that to a user on the front-end in real time.

This project uses the (golang-standards project-layout)[https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout] for folder structure consistency.
